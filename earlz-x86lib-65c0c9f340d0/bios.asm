;How to get additional CPUs
;The total numbers of CPUs are in 0x800.
;In order to put additional cpus into action, you must do some things.
;the base address of each CPU (after CPU #0) is 0x700,0x710,0x720.
;first, the SS is from 0x02 and SP is from 0x04
;Note that an iret is done from this stack!
;and finally, mov 1 to 0x01 and it will put the cpu into action...
