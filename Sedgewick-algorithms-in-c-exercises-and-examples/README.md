Algorithms in C
================================================
My takes of **Algorithms in C - Fundamentals, Data Structures, Sorting, Searching (3rd Edition)** book by **Robert Sedgewick**.
It contains code for both the **examples** and the **exercises**.

###Organization

Each *dir* has only the code from the specific chapter.

Each *dir* contains 2 *subdirs*, one with the code for the examples and one with answers for the exercises.

###Compiling

All the programs were compiled with the `-std=c99` flag and should work out of the box.

###Missing & Other 

Some of the answers for particular exercises are missing.
I have omitted exercises which require only a explanatory type of solution or for which I found no value in solving.

**Most of the latest chapters have no exercises**.

Some of the examples are not 100% according to the book, because I tried to make them work in a practical way (are more than only scattered code snippets).
Therefore some examples contain code I have added in order to compile and work with some input.
